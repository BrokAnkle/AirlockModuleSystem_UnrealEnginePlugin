# AirLockSystem_UnrealEnginePlugin
Welcome to the open sourced Airlock Module System plugin for Unreal Engine. This plugin contains only code and a level sample for demo.
The system is entirely event based and use event dispatchers to signal the state of the module, which makes it easy to understand and to override.  
This is the C++ only version, which I made sure to be easily overridable, extandable and usable in BP.  

C++ DOCUMENTATION IS COMING SOON  
  
Tutorial: COMING SOON
