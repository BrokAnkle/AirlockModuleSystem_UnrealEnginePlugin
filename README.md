# AirLockSystem_UnrealEnginePlugin
Welcome to the open sourced Airlock Module System plugin for Unreal Engine. This plugin contains only code and a level sample for demo.
The system is entirely event based and use event dispatchers to signal the state of the module, which makes it easy to understand and to override.  
BP only and C++ only are available, for the C++ version, I made sure evrything is overridable and usable in BP.  
The few assets used come from the Unreal Engine Starter Content.

DOCUMENTATION IN THE WIKI (still WIP at the moment)  

If any problem, suggestion, bugs etc... Please contact me.
